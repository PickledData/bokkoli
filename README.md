# Bokkoli
CLI app for veggie to veggie messaging on a single platter.
 
Bokkoli is a peer-to-peer TCP messaging CLI application built with Go, the Bubbletea framework, and SQLite for message persistence. The name is a playful fusion of "broccoli" and "보끔" (boggeum, Korean for "mix"), reflecting its nature as a blend of technologies.
This lightweight chat application enables direct peer-to-peer communication through a clean, terminal-based interface. With Bokkoli, users can easily establish connections and exchange messages in real-time using TCP protocol, while SQLite ensures your conversation history is safely stored locally.
